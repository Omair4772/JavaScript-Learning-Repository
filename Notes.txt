environment setup / learned How to print a statement / learned some github online work that how its work.

console.log("Omair Ahmad Khalil")   
// shortcut for console.log is just type log and then enter the suggestion
for checking js intalled or not just type (node -v) in the terminal
for Output we use (node Basic_1\test.js)

// for printing more then oneline you can print it by using console.table() METHOD
console.table([account_email, account_password, account_city, account_state]);





<!-- Day 2 -->




Learning about variables 

const accountId = "11223344" // value will be assigned one time /  for unchangable values use const method
let account_email = "omair@git.com" // let is the new way for initializing the variable and its bugs free
var account_password = "111111"     // var is the old way for initializing  variables. it has some issues with the like scoping the variables (scope is {} ) so developer decides to use let method
account_city = "peshawar"   // javascript can also initialize variables without adding the var/let before but we don't prefer it.

// for printing more then oneline you can print it by using console.table() METHOD
console.table([account_email, account_password, account_city, account_state]);

// Updating Above variables 
account_Id = "1111"    // This is not allowed because account_Id is a CONST variable


// DATATYPES AND ECMA

"Use strict"; // This Allows the compiler to treat all the javaScript code as a newer version

ECMA is a website for writting a standerd of codes it gives us the rules to follow that


//OBJECT

console.log(typeof loggin); // Typeof is used for to find a type of the variable

//null is a object // undefine is a undefine typeof
